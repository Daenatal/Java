main() is the entry point for our methods
keep an eye on static

Intro to data types, intro to primitive vs object types

A variable is a piece of memory we can assign data to make it easy to use.

Every variable requires a type declaration when we initialize it.

pattern is type variableName;

to assign, use variableName = value;

Data Types---

Primitive Types--

- Int: holds integers from negative 2 bil to positive 2 bil
- Long: for really big numbers
- boolean: true or false
- double: for decimals, far more precise than float
- char: used to store a single char like 'A'

Object Types---

- Integer: this class wraps a value of the primitive type int into an object
- Long: Wraps a value of the primitive type long in an object
- Boolean: Wraps a value of the primitive type boolean in an object
- double
- Character: 
- String: Represents a sequence or characters
- BigInteger: Represents an integer that can be any size at all. 

primitives are lower while object types are capitalized

Type Casting----

How to change types in Java, for example byte to int

Explicit vs Implicit:

One you cast, the other happens automatically. Make sure memory is sufficient for the type
being casted to.

When do we use one over the other? 

1. Performance: Object types are an instance of a class. They hold data and methods, therefore
memory capactiy is much bigger than their primitive counterpart.

2. null values: Primitive data types can only hold data. However, Object types 
are pointers to where the data is stored. Pointers can point to nothing (Null), primitives can't.

Importing----

- Import different java classes into project
- Use test file to run java classes

Seperate class info from the testing and running information.

So we create a non main method class.

import statement = import java.util.Date;

check for best practices and deprecation

*We will now be creating a test file that runs our java classes
